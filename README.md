Hello everyone,

This time something small: I've created the beginning of a construction site at the bridge west of the island at Zancudo Bridge, as this bridge is one of the most important ones. NPCs also reduce their speed.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome. For any ideas or feedback, feel free to contact me via direct message.
